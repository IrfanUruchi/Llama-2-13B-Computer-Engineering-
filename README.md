# Llama-2-13B-Computer-Engineering

### Overview

**Llama-2-13B-Computer-Engineering** is a fineâ€‘tuned variant of **LLaMAâ€‘2â€‘13B**, adapted for **computer engineering, computer architecture, systems, and algorithms**.  
The model was trained using **QLoRA (4â€‘bit quantization)**, then merged into a single checkpoint.  
This allows **13Bâ€‘scale reasoning** to run in ~6.6 GB of storage and ~16GB of GPU memory, making it usable on a single modern GPU.

---

### Training Setup
- **Base model:** [LLaMAâ€‘2â€‘13B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf)  
- **Fineâ€‘tuning method:** QLoRA (4â€‘bit NF4) + LoRA adapters (`r=16`, `Î±=32`)  
- **Optimized Layers:** Attention projection modules (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj`)  
- **Final merge:** LoRA weights merged into the base model â†’ single merged checkpoint  
- **Resulting size:** ~6.6 GB (`safetensors` sharded files) vs. ~24 GB fp16 
(Model Safetensor files are avaiable on the Model weights here just the tokenizers and configs files are avaiable)

---

## Dataset
The dataset was curated from multiple sources to emphasize **reasoning, explanations, and code writing in computer engineering contexts**.  

Included sources:
- **MMLU (Computer Security subset)** â†’ examâ€‘style questions on systems and security  
- **CodeAlpacaâ€‘20k (filtered)** â†’ algorithm, data structures, complexity, trees, sorting/searching, graphs  
- **OpenOrca subset** â†’ reasoning tasks mentioning computer systems and architecture  
- **Custom technical examples** (handâ€‘crafted) on:
  - CPU pipelining & instructionâ€‘level parallelism  
  - Cache coherency and MESI protocol  
  - Compiler optimizations (instruction scheduling, inlining, loop unrolling)  
  - RISC vs. CISC architectures  
  - Memory hierarchies (registers, caches, RAM, storage)  
  - Branch prediction  
  - Example algorithms (binary search, stacks, etc.)

### Usage


```python

model_id = "Irfanuruchi/Llama-2-13B-Computer-Engineering"

)

```

## Example Responses

Q: What is cache coherency in multicore systems?
A: Cache coherence ensures that all processor cores observe a consistent view of memory. Protocols such as MESI handle invalidation and updates when one core modifies data, preventing stale values and race conditions.

Q: Implement a stack in Python.
A: Produces a Stack class with methods for push, pop, peek, is_empty, and size.

## Limitations

- While optimized for computer engineering, performance outside this scope is similar to the base LLaMAâ€‘2â€‘13B.
